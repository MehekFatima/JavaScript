FizzBuzz

This repository contains a simple JavaScript implementation of the classic FizzBuzz problem using an arrow function.


It involves printing numbers from 1 to a specified limit while following these rules:

-> For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz"

-> For numbers divisible by 5, print "Buzz"

-> For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"

-> Otherwise, print the number itself
